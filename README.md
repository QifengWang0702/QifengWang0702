# 👋 Hi, I'm Wang Qifeng (王 淇锋)

🎓 **PhD Candidate in Software Engineering (Dalian University of Technology, China)**<br>
🎓 **Visiting PhD in Bioengineering (Imperial College London, UK)**  
💡 Researcher in **Medical Image Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, and Foundation Models**,<br>
   focusing on **ultrasound-based segmentation, reconstruction, and clinical quantification**.

---

## 🔬 Research & Interests
- **Fetal Cardiac Ultrasound (4D)**: 3D reconstruction and segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) with temporal consistency; development of **foundation models** integrating multi-task learning for 4D (3D+time) echocardiography.  
- **Fetal Brain Ultrasound (2D & 3D)**: Automated localization and segmentation of **corpus callosum (CC)**, **cerebellar vermis (CV)**, and **cavum septum pellucidum (CSP)**; clinical validation for prenatal diagnostics.  
- **Foundation Models in Medical Imaging**: Self-supervised learning and scalable pipelines for multi-modal ultrasound data.
